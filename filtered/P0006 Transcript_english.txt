P: wife，culture，network……growgrow to a certain levelbarrier，ceiling，ceilingreachlevel，，culturecommunicationbuild network，contribution，culturereally good at the technical, but to let them like supervise manager a big organization it's uh they don't think that this will be suitable. company the executive of very high level, it's in their culture, it’s just like this. I think even for my current career level is this for this organization and working  reach  most like the top. If I want to keep going up, I have to find maybe a startup to move one level up then I'll find maybe another opportunity.

00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,230




00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,720
P: Asian Americans levelladder. First um they work really really hard. The people we hired, most of the Asian people they work very hard. And also very responsible or accountable and usually very skillful. And they really got a certain level because their hard work, because  attitude, attitude. generalAsian Americansnumber one. ，accent, and also some times oralwritingcommunication also limit  growth. ，culture, especiallyindustry, get into a connection with people, you have to have the American culture. ,  peoplego to next level , , ,  hold accountable, if there's something you deserve it you take it,  but if there's a blame you have to take, you just need to be responsible, don’t push out things if it's yours is yours. And also Asian people sometimestraightforward. , 。， American culture，miss，，pointa lot of time you will be missed. You’ll be ignored. you you you have no opportunity. Yeah so I think, being a straightforward being transparent, just out spoken yeah. At least what I believe I should be and  try to educatechildren to just speak up. 。




00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,560




00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,190
P: absolutely I want them to be 10 but realistically I hope they can be um eight or nine or six even seven is good at least I want them to be seven I want them to be much better than us yeah. And and they have all this opportunity. They have the language and also education, American culture, yeah I think they should be better. But we all knowhow competitive right now is. So it is tough and even get into the Ivy League all these kind of things it's very tough and there's so many different things now. So I think for them the first challenge they will see really that the difference and the problem is the college enrollment. A lot of the children they are qualified for Ivy League but they couldn't get in anymore so that I would say is their first thing. And then second thing is they will face is of course during the college and they need to find a job and this will be second thing Then the third thing will be their career. So let's see you know. I try to encourage my children but it it all depends on themselves. 




00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,500




00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:13,030
P: For sure I want them to be ten but it's it's very it's impossible. It's very difficult. We can only provide certain things and also relate to each child’s personality you know, their experience. At least I want them to be seven or eight. That’s what I hope for. 




00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,670




00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,430
P: I would say still seven or eight. cannot provide private school forhigh school right. So we cannot. Yeah I think the same to a makes sense. We try our best. 




00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,680




00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,150
P: First thing I want them to have somethingpassionlike it. That's number one. Secondhighgoodincome can support them. They definitely need something they can grow the career they don't want to stop. they just have to take it. make some contribution to ，。To do some real contribution，what I hoped.
